Despite her ability to easily break away, she doesn't even try. Why? It starts when she is young. She is first tied down when she is small and not yet strong enough to break the rope. She'll try at first, try as hard as she can to break free, and try and try, but eventually realize she can't. Suddenly, something attaches itself to her that is stronger than any rope or chain or fence. It's the belief that she can't break free. It's this belief that holds her back - despite her ability. ",

            "text": "I finally learned this lesson. My headset led me to law school. There my long-held false beliefs were reinforced: aim for perfection, follow the crowd, fear failure. This was a familiar path. Then one day, without thinking much about it, I signed up for a class outside the law school, called Design Thinking Boot Camp, a class that promised to unleash my creative potential. I had to design innovative products and experiences, or more accurately, pull on almost every single one of my ropes. I had to trust my own voice because when it comes to innovation, there is by definition no one to look to for the answers. I had to put myself out there because innovation doesn't come from playing it safe. And perhaps most importantly, I had to be willing to fail, to be willing to not be perfect. The best designs came only after multiple failed attempts. If I wanted to get it right, I first had to be willing to get it wrong. I struggled in this class because all of the things that would help me succeed were the same things I believed for so many years I shouldn't do. I finally gave in to their crazy approach, and the most amazing thing happened. I was free to go, play, try things, experiment - to live as I had before my ropes. I felt free in a way I hadn't since I was six years old, and I accomplished things I never would have imagined possible. I was astounded, proud, liberated - and confused. I wondered if the beliefs that held me back in this class were the same ones holding me back in other parts of my life. The seed had been planted. Maybe I shouldn't believe everything I think. Headset off. To take it off, I just had to realize I had it on. Ropes broken. New beliefs lead to new actions. ",
            "translation": "我终于学会了这一课。我的眼镜让我进入法学院。在那里，长期跟着我的虚假执念被强化了：以完美为目标、跟随群众、恐惧失败。这是条熟悉的路。有一天，没多想什么，我登记参加了一堂法学院外的课，叫做「设计思维训练营」，这堂课保证能释放我的创造潜能。我得要设计出创新的产品和体验，或更精确地说，要去拉扯我的每一条绳子。我得要相信自己的声音，因为创新的定义，就是没有人能给你答案。我得让自己走出舒适圈，因为打安全牌不会带来创新。也许最重要的是，我必须愿意承受失败，愿意接受不完美。唯有数次失败之后，才会产生最好的设计。如果我想要把它做对，我得愿意先犯错。在这班我很辛苦，因为能够协助我成功的一切，都是数年来我相信我不该去做的事。我终于屈服接受他们的疯狂方法，接着最惊人的事发生了。我感到自己能自由地去玩、去尝试、去实验——去过着被绳子束缚前的生活。从六岁之后我就没有感到这么自由了，我也完成了以前想都不敢想的事情。我很惊讶、骄傲、解放——且困惑。我想知道在这堂课中限制我的那些执念，是否同样也在我人生的其他部分中限制了我。种子已经种下。也许我不该尽信自己所有的想法。拿掉虚拟眼镜。要能拿掉眼镜，我得先要知道我已给自己戴上眼镜。绳子断了。新的信念带来新的行动。",

            "text": "In my first bold move since I was six, I turned down my offer to work at a law firm and placed myself in a different reality. I experimented with different jobs and took on various side projects, saying yes to ones I previously would have said no to due to lack of experience, trusting I could figure it out. I was still afraid of failure and taking wrong turns, and sometimes I did. I just no longer let this stop me. Then one day, I took on a 10-week part-time position, coaching speakers. I fell in love with this work. We're talking Fernando-level love. (Laughter) No longer afraid to grab things with both hands, I went on to start my own company, helping leaders become more powerful speakers and to teach a communication class at Stanford. Particularly meaningful for me is that I now get to give others what I'd lost for so long - a more powerful voice. ",

            "text": "I broke other ropes too. When I was self-conscious and shy, I never could have imagined revealing my insecurities to you on a TED stage. (Laughter) That would have sounded more like a bad dream. Yet somehow, here I am. This process didn't happen overnight. Each new thought, each new action built on the one before it until I found myself in a new reality. I still have ropes I'm working to break. My goal is fewer over time. To get there, I remind myself of the marshmallow challenge. Teams of four are given 20 sticks of spaghetti, a yard of string, a yard of tape and a marshmallow. The winning team is the one that can build the tallest freestanding tower they can in 18 minutes. The marshmallow has to be on top. This challenge has been given all over the world to business-school students, lawyers, CEOs, CTOs, engineers. Who do you think are among the top performers? Recent graduates of kindergarten. (Laughter) Here's why. The other groups will take what they think they know, what they think is the single right answer, and end up executing in the wrong direction. In contrast, kindergarteners stay open to multiple possibilities. They test out different options, they gather information by experimenting until they find the best way forward. They have fun. What makes us so amazing as children is we live in a world before ropes. In a world before \"what's known,\" when there is \"what's possible.\" In a world before \"I can't,\" when there is \"how could I?\" In a world before falling and staying down, when we fall and get right back up again - undeterred. In a world in which nothing is holding us back from our full capacity. ",

No matter who you are or where you are, in this moment, there is the life that you can be living if you break your ropes.
