            "text": "This elephant has incredible strength. She can uproot a tree with her trunk alone. Yet she will remain in captivity, held by only a light rope. Despite her ability to easily break away, she doesn't even try. Why? It starts when she is young. She is first tied down when she is small and not yet strong enough to break the rope. She'll try at first, try as hard as she can to break free, and try and try, but eventually realize she can't. Suddenly, something attaches itself to her that is stronger than any rope or chain or fence. It's the belief that she can't break free. It's this belief that holds her back - despite her ability. ",
            "translation": "这只大象有很不可思议的力气，它只用象鼻就能把树连根拔起。但它却仍然被一条细绳给囚禁着。尽管它有能力可以轻易挣脱，它却试也不试。为什么？这要从它年轻时说起。它很小时就被绑住，当时的力气还不足以扯断绳子。一开始它会尝试，尽力去挣脱，一试再试，最终，它了解到自己办不到。突然间，某种比绳子、铁链、栅栏都还要强的东西跟它紧系在一起了。就是相信自己无法挣脱的执念。是这种执念限制了它——尽管它有能力。",

So that afternoon, I started my first company. I gathered rocks from around the neighborhood, painted them with my art set, and went door to door, selling them to our neighbors. That night, it was Amber and I on the couch together.",

As with everything else, I wasn't afraid to grab him with both hands. (Laughter) As I grew older, this picture started to fade. My exuberance was replaced with timidness, my leadership with conformity, my boldness with fear. I don't think any of us leave childhood without some ropes despite our parents' best intentions. ",

I'd pack a suitcase to go on a school trip, and she'd unpack it and repack it in a more perfect way. I'd be ready to turn in a school art project, and then she'd add her own brush strokes to make it better. Later she told me when my choice of boyfriend or apartment wasn't good enough. Although she just wanted what was best for me, I stopped knowing what was best for me. An unconscious rope was formed. I shouldn't trust my own voice and my own ability, and I feared not being perfect. ",
            "translation": "成长过程中，母亲决心要给我一个完美的人生。带着爱和好意，她为了帮我达到完美，什么都做了。为了学校旅行，我打包了一个行李箱，而她会把东西都拿出来，再重新打包得更完美。我准备好要交一篇学校的美术作品，她会帮我加上几笔让作品变更好。之后她告诉我，我选男友或公寓的品味不够好。虽然她只是想要给我最好的，我却不再知道什么才是对我最好的。一条无意识的绳子形成了。我不应该相信我自己的声音、我自己的能力，我害怕无法做到完美。",

To keep the peace, I learned to stay quiet, to not rock the boat, to become invisible. In school, I came to believe it's more important to blend in than stand out. And the pain of an early heartbreak led me to hold back in my relationships so I could avoid getting hurt. I'm not good enough. Don't speak up. Don't stand out.",
